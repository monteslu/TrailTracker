# TrailTracker: Android Recording App

TrailTracker is a minimal Android app for recording timestamped camera frames and GPS+compass data during cycling routes. The app is designed for clean, structured output with no post-processing or analysis features.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Capture 1080p 30fps images with WebP compression (92%)
- Log GPS location and compass heading in JSONL format
- Save to a uniquely named folder per route
- Designed for later processing using external tools
