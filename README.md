# TrailTracker: Android Recording App

TrailTracker is a minimal Android app for recording timestamped camera frames and GPS+compass data during cycling routes. The app is designed for clean, structured output with no post-processing or analysis features.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Capture 1080p 30fps images with JPEG compression (85%)
- Log GPS location and compass heading in JSONL format
- Save to app-private storage per route
- Designed for later processing using external tools

## ðŸ§  Session Behavior

- New route creates new folder
- If folder exists, resumes into it
- **Paused by default until `Start` is pressed**

- Selecting `Start New Session` while recording will:
  - Automatically pause current session
  - Prompt user to enter a new route name
  - Begin a new recording session into a new folder
